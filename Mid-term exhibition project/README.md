# Exhibition record

In March's exhibition, Xu Ziqing and I collaborated on a physical space-based untangling rope game ðŸª¢.

The game involved setting up three ropes of different colors, with six players participating. Each player held one end of a rope, and those who held ropes of the same color formed a team. The team that untangled their rope first would win. At the time, we found this game fun but relatively simple. So, I came up with the idea of adding a camera to the ceiling and using OpenCV technology to recognize the three colors ðŸŸ¥ðŸŸ¨ðŸŸ¦ of the ropes and record them. After the game ended, we could generate an image showing the traces of the ropes.

This project generated a high level of engagement among everyone involvedðŸ˜ƒ. The process of untangling the ropes brought joy to each person. When I showcased the generated images, they discussed which team was the most skilled based on the colors.

Here are some videos and photos taken at that time:

The mid-term exhibition was a great success, and I am grateful to everyone who came to visit! ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³ðŸ¥³
