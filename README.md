# CreativeMaking-Final-Project

Through this course, I have completed two projects. 

One is the rope game "Tugging Twisting Tracing"ðŸª¢ that I collaborated on with Ziqing during the March exhibition. (Video: https://youtu.be/wiVilS-X1rQ)

The other is my individual AR project "Portal to Pixels"ðŸ¦œ for the final assignment. (Video: https://youtu.be/HA2jxKHFjMk)
